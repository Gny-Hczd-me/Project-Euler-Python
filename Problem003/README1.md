#​Project Euler #3: Largest Prime Factor
​This script finds the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143. It uses a brute-force trial division approach combined with a primality test to identify the maximum factor.
​How it Works
​The algorithm follows these logical steps:
​Iterative Search: It starts from num = 2 and increments by 1 in a while loop.
​Primality Test: For every num, it checks if the number is prime using the condition:
all(num % i != 0 for i in range(2, int(pow(num, 0.5)) + 1))
​Divisibility Check: If num is prime, the script checks if it can divide the target number a without a remainder.
​Reduction: When a prime factor is found, it is stored in the max variable, and the target number a is divided by this factor to reduce the search space.
​Result: Once the loop completes, the last stored max value is printed as the largest prime factor.
